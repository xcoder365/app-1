we need a github account (free)

download github for desktop to sync repository

create a public app-1 repository and sync with an empty local folder
in my case d:\app-to-render\app-1  (empty at first)

then we create and app1.py (code generated with chatgbt) ,
data.csv (what ever you like)
requirements.txt to install libraries
